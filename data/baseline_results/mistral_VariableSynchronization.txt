**1. Functionality**

VariableSynchronization is a mechanism to save and restore TensorFlow variables as raw numpy arrays. This feature is primarily used to maintain compatibility between TensorFlow 1 and TensorFlow 2 during the conversion of a TensorFlow 1 model to TensorFlow 2. By using this method, it is possible to load the trained values from TensorFlow 2 into TensorFlow 1 and populate the parameters with these values using the `session.run()` function.

**2. Concept**

Conceptually, VariableSynchronization allows for the management of tensorflow variables across different versions (TensorFlow 1 and TensorFlow 2) of the same program. To achieve variable synchronization, a dictionary is created to map the TensorFlow variables in TensorFlow 2 to their names in TensorFlow 1. On the TensorFlow 1 side, `tf.trainable_variables()` function is used to fetch the list of trainable variables, and the serialized dictionary is used to assign the values to the variables using `session.run()`.

**3. Pattern**

The pattern for VariableSynchronization between TensorFlow and TensorFlow 2 involves the following steps:

1. Create a dictionary mapping TensorFlow variables in TensorFlow 2 to their names in TensorFlow 1.
2. On TensorFlow 2 side, fetch the list of trainable variables using `tf.trainable_variables()`.
3. Assign the trained values to the TensorFlow 1 variables using `session.run()`.

**4. Performance**

Although the performance impact of VariableSynchronization is not explicitly mentioned in the provided post, it should be noted that the process involves creating dictionaries, serializing data, and using `session.run()`, which are overhead operations when working with large datasets. Expect some performance overhead when working with a large number of variables or large datasets using VariableSynchronization.

**5. Alternative**

As an alternative to VariableSynchronization, consider the following options:

1. Use TensorFlow 2 compatible libraries or functions to maintain compatibility instead of converting a TensorFlow 1 model to TensorFlow 2.
2. Use other deep learning libraries such as PyTorch or Keras to save and load your models if you encounter performance issues with VariableSynchronization.

**6. Environment**

VariableSynchronization is used in a TensorFlow environment where TensorFlow 1 and TensorFlow 2 are required to maintain compatibility during conversion. To use VariableSynchronization, ensure that both TensorFlow 1 and TensorFlow 2 are compatible with the system and are installed.

**7. Directive**

When using VariableSynchronization, keep the following directives in mind:

1. Ensure that the variables are named consistently in TensorFlow 1 and TensorFlow 2 when saving and loading the models.
2. Be aware of the potential performance overhead during the conversion process, and optimize the code where possible.
3. If you encounter any issues with VariableSynchronization, consult the TensorFlow documentation or seek help from the TensorFlow community for guidance.
