# GradientTape API Documentation

## Functionality
- **Automatic Differentiation**: `tf.GradientTape` provides a mechanism to compute gradients of computations with respect to input variables, typically `tf.Variables`.
- **Gradient and Jacobian Calculation**: It computes gradients or jacobians of a recorded computation using reverse mode differentiation.
- **Multi-step Gradient Process**: Allows computing, processing, and applying gradients in multi-step processes.

## Concept
- **Tape Context**: Operations executed within the context of `tf.GradientTape` are recorded onto a "tape".
- **Watch Method**: Use `tape.watch(tensor)` to manually track tensors that aren't automatically tracked.
- **Higher-order Derivatives**: Achieved by creating nested `GradientTape` objects.

## Pattern
- **Recording Operations**: Utilize `with tf.GradientTape() as tape:` block to record operations for differentiation.
- **Gradient Calculation**: Use `tape.gradient(target, sources)` to calculate gradients.
- **Multiple Models**: Aggregate trainable variables from multiple models for joint optimization.

## Performance
- **Eager Execution**: Compatible with eager execution to monitor gradients, a default in TensorFlow 2.x.
- **Persistent Tapes**: Create persistent gradient tapes with `persistent=True` for computing multiple gradients over identical computations.

## Alternative
- **Graph & Eager Modes**: Operates seamlessly in both eager and graph modes, not requiring a `tf.function` wrapper.

## Environment
- **TensorFlow Installation**: Requires TensorFlow to be installed, especially compatible with TensorFlow 2.x.
- **Trainable Tensors**: Gradients are computed for "trainable" tensors, necessitating conversion to `tf.Variable` if they aren't already.

## Directive
- **Tracking Variables**: Implicitly tracks `tf.Variables` in its context, with an option to track specific tensors via `tape.watch()`.
- **Compute Outside Context**: Calculations using `tape.gradient()` should be performed outside the `with` context.
- **Persistent Usage**: Use persistent tapes if multiple gradient computations on the same operations are required. 

This API is essential for training neural networks by automatically computing the gradients of loss functions concerning model parameters and effectively applying these gradients to optimize model performance.
