1. The ActionBar makes important actions accessible in a predictable way, such as the Search action.
2. It supports consistent navigation and view switching within apps, especially when using the navigation component.
3. The ActionBar reduces clutter by providing an action overflow for rarely used actions.
4. It provides a dedicated space for giving an app an identity.
The ActionBar provides the following functionalities:
1. A dedicated space for giving your app an identity and indicating the user's location within the app.
2. Access to important actions in a predictable way, such as search.
3. Support for navigation and view switching, using tabs or drop-down lists.
ActionBar is used to set the title of the action bar at the top of the activity screen: `actionBar.setTitle("ACTIONBAR TITLE");`.

- "ActionBar is the element present at the top of the activity screen. It is a salient feature of a mobile application that has a consistent presence over all its activities."
- "Toolbar is a View included in a layout like any other View. As a regular View, the toolbar is easier to position, animate and control. Multiple distinct Toolbar elements can be defined within a single activity."
When using ActionBar in Android:

- Ensure not to set titles for both the ActionBar and a custom Toolbar simultaneously without understanding their different roles; this could lead to issues since they might conflict. Use ActionBar for a consistent presence across activities and Toolbar for more localized and dynamic scenarios.
- Use `getSupportActionBar()` to retrieve the ActionBar and set titles using `actionBar.setTitle("ACTIONBAR TITLE")`.
'ActionBar is commonly used to provide a consistent and predictable way to access important actions, support app navigation and view switching, reduce UI clutter through action overflow, and give the app an identity.'
ActionBar is commonly used for providing a consistent and familiar user interface across different Android apps by offering a dedicated space for app identity, user location indication, predictable access to important actions like search, and support for navigation and view switching.

Alternatives to ActionBar include Toolbar, which offers more flexibility such as adding background images and animations.
An alternative to using `ActionBar` in the context of handling navigation UI in an Android app is to use `AppBarConfiguration` with `NavigationUI` for managing the app bar and navigation drawer interactions. This approach eliminates the need for `ActionBarDrawerToggle` by automatically handling the transition between the drawer icon and the Up icon. The alternative setup involves using `DrawerLayout`, `NavigationView`, and handling menu item selections with `setNavigationItemSelectedListener`.
