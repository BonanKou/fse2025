Here is the API document for MediaPlayer, organized into seven sections: Functionality, Concept, Pattern, Performance, Alternative, Environment, and Directive.

**Functionality**

* Play audio files
* Play audio and video files
* Provide features such as seeking, looping, and volume control
* Support equalization through the Equalizer class
* Request the playback engine of the Android system to play music
* Have a `release()` method to release system resources
* Can be used to tell the system that a media session is happening in an app
* Can inform the system when it is active or playing, which gives the app priority over media controllers on the remote
* Can be used to indicate when a media session is no longer active, allowing other applications to access the media controllers
* Can play music and request the playback engine of the Android system to play music
* Can have a playback state, which can be obtained using `mediaController.playbackState`

**Concept**

* A class in Android used for playing audio and video files
* Takes an input file as long as it is encoded as an audio or video file
* Can handle audio and video files with different file extensions as long as the content is still encoded as audio or video
* Provides features such as seeking, looping, and volume control
* Supports equalization through the Equalizer class
* Is an intermediary between the application and the Android system's playback engine
* Holds a reference to system resources, which need to be explicitly released when no longer in use to prevent resource leaks
* Can be instantiated using a Builder, which allows for customization of the player
* Needs to be prepared and started to play the media

**Pattern**

* Commonly used for playing audio files
* Commonly used with Media Session to notify the system about the media playback state and gain priority over media controllers
* Commonly used to play sound on Android
* Commonly used to play audio and video files
* Commonly used with the Equalizer for audio effects
* Commonly used to play music, but it doesn't directly play the music, instead, it requests the playback engine of the Android system to play the music
* Commonly used to get the currently playing media and its playback state
* Commonly used in conjunction with MediaRecorder to record and play back audio or video content
* Commonly used to resume playback from a paused state, especially when interrupted by other media playback operations

**Performance**

* Failing to call the `release()`
