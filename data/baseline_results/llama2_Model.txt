 API Document: TensorFlow Model Class

Functionality:

* Can be used to define a model for training on a dataset
* Can be used to create a different model based on the graph of the trained model but excludes the head of it
* Can be used to save the weights of the new model for transfer learning
* Can be used with the `GlobalAveragePooling2D()` layer and the `Dense()` layer
* Accepts tensors as inputs when called during eager execution
* Raises an error if the input is not a tensor

Concept:

* The `Model` class in TensorFlow is used to define a model for training on a dataset
* The model can be created using the `Model()` constructor and can be based on the graph of a trained model
* The model can be used for transfer learning by saving the weights of the new model

Pattern:

* The `Model` class follows the builder pattern, where the model's input shape can be specified in the strategy scope using one of the following methods:
	+ Calling `model.build()` after the model is created
	+ Defining `input_shape` of the first layer of the model in the `__init__()` method
	+ Using a real tensor (e.g. ones, zeros, etc.) to call `model(tensor)` after the model is created

Performance:

* The `Model` class is designed to work efficiently with large datasets and complex models
* The use of the `GlobalAveragePooling2D()` layer and the `Dense()` layer can improve the performance of the model

Alternative:

* There are other ways to define a model in TensorFlow, such as using the `keras` module

Environment:

* The `Model` class can be used in a variety of environments, including Python and JavaScript

Directive:

* It is important to note that the `Model` class is a part of the TensorFlow API and should be used in conjunction with other TensorFlow classes and functions to create and train a model.
