 API Document: Java Message Service (JMS) API

Functionality:

* The MessageDigest class is used to create a message object that can be published to a destination.
* The class has a private constructor, indicating that it is not meant to be instantiated directly.
* The class has a static method, main, which is used to demonstrate the usage of the class.
* The main method creates a MessageSender object and sets a MessageID field, which is an array of 24 bytes.
* The MessageID field cannot be set to a string value.
* Alternative fields such as Message Type and CorrelationID headers can be used instead of MessageID.
* CorrelationID is functionally identical to MessageID.

Concept:

* The JMS API does not distinguish between end-user interfaces and messaging driver programmer interfaces, which can cause confusion.

Pattern:

* The MessageDigest class follows the Singleton pattern, with a private constructor and a static method for creating a message object.

Performance:

* The MessageDigest class is optimized for performance, with a static method for creating a message object and a private constructor to prevent unnecessary instantiation.

Alternative:

* Alternative fields such as Message Type and CorrelationID headers can be used instead of MessageID.

Environment:

* The MessageDigest class is designed to work in a messaging environment, where messages are published to destinations and consumed by message listeners.

Directive:

* The post suggests sending the message first and then reading the MessageID field back to obtain the generated value for auditing, correlation, or other purposes.
