Here is the API document summarizing the knowledge snippets into seven sections: functionality, concept, pattern, performance, alternative, environment, and directive.

**Functionality**

* Generate unique identifiers
* Create identifiers without a central registration authority
* Create identifiers without coordinating between parties generating them
* `UUID.randomUUID()` generates a new random UUID
* `UUID.randomUUID().toString()` gets a string representation of the generated UUID
* UUID can be used to uniquely identify a resource
* UUID can be used as a unique identifier
* UUID can be stored in a column of a document entity
* UUID objects can be used to identify and associate data with a particular user
* UUID objects can be used as a criteria in database queries
* UUID can be used as a primary key for an entity
* UUID can be used to store an ID value
* UUID can be used in conjunction with JPA to set an ID field based on a reference value

**Concept**

* UUID stands for universally unique identifier
* UUIDs are designed to generate unique identifiers without depending on a central registration authority, and without coordinating between the parties generating them
* UUIDs are used to identify entities uniquely
* UUIDs are typically used in distributed systems or scenarios where a centralized authority is not available or feasible
* A UUID is a unique identifier
* UUIDs can be randomly generated
* UUIDs are typically used as identifiers for objects
* UUIDs can be controlled and specified explicitly
* UUIDs can come from various sources, such as a Factory object or a database
* UUID is a class in Java that can be used to generate unique identifiers
* UUID can be represented as a string
* UUID strings typically contain hyphens
* UUID objects can be generated randomly using the `randomUUID()` method
* UUID is often used as a unique identifier for entities or objects
* UUID is universally unique
* UUIDs use 128 bits to store information
* UUIDs are difficult to guess, making them suitable for use as unique identifiers

**Pattern**

* `UUID.randomUUID()` is commonly used to generate a random identifier
* UUID is commonly used as an identifier in objects
* UUID can be used in conjunction with a Factory object or a database to generate identifiers in a controlled manner
* UUID is commonly used to generate unique IDs, especially in the context of Hibernate identifier generation
* UUID is used as a unique identifier in a document entity
* UUID is used as an alternative to integer numbers when security is a concern
