 API Document: GradientTape

Functionality:

* GradientTape is used for automatic differentiation in TensorFlow, computing the gradient of a computation with respect to its input variables.
* It records relevant operations executed inside its context onto a "tape".
* The tape can then be used to compute gradients/jacobians of a recorded computation using reverse mode differentiation.
* The gradient/jacobian can be computed outside the context of the tape after the forward pass has been executed.
* GradientTape can handle lists of variables and compute gradients for each variable separately, even when they have different shapes.
* It keeps track of operations for automatic differentiation and computes gradients of a loss function with respect to each variable in a list of variables, without the need for concatenating them.
* GradientTape can be used to compute gradients of a loss function with respect to multiple variables, including trainable variables from multiple models, in a single training step.

Concept:

* GradientTape is a class in TensorFlow that allows for automatic differentiation and computation of gradients/jacobians of a computation with respect to some inputs.
* It records relevant operations onto a "tape" and then uses that tape to compute the gradients/jacobians.

Pattern:

* GradientTape is used to compute gradients of a loss function with respect to multiple variables, including trainable variables from multiple models, in a single training step.
* It can handle lists of variables and compute gradients for each variable separately, even when they have different shapes.

Performance:

* GradientTape holds resources for computing gradients and releases them when the GradientTape.gradient() method is called.
* It creates a persistent gradient tape to allow multiple calls to the gradient() method.
* Resources are released when the tape object is garbage collected.

Alternative:

* Minimize() is the equivalent of optimizer.step() in TensorFlow, and it takes care of both computing the gradients and applying them to the variables.
* If one wants to process the gradients before applying them, they can use the optimizer in three steps: compute the gradients with tf.GradientTape, process the gradients as desired, and apply
