Here is the API document for MBeanServer, organized into seven sections: functionality, concept, pattern, performance, alternative, environment, and directive.

**Functionality**

* Get a reference to the MBeanServer instance
* Run a query with an ObjectName
* Build and provide access to MBeans (Managed Beans) in a Java application, specifically in a WebLogic server instance

**Concept**

* MBeanServer is an object that can be referenced
* MBeanServer is used to run queries
* Queries on MBeanServer are executed using an ObjectName
* MBeanServer is related to Java Management Extensions (JMX) technology
* MBeanServer is a builder-based architecture
* MBeanServer is specific to a Java EE application server (in this case, WebLogic)
* MBeanServer is responsible for managing and providing access to MBeans (Managed Beans)
* MBeanServer is likely a singleton or a global instance

**Pattern**

* MBeanServer is commonly used to run a query with an ObjectName
* MBeanServer is commonly used to provide access to WebLogic's MBeans in a server instance
* MBeanServer is commonly used to expose application-specific management data through a JMX interface

**Performance**

* MBeanServer has overhead when accessing a large number of sessions through the `findSessions()` method, which can consume a significant amount of memory

**Alternative**

* None mentioned

**Environment**

* MBeanServer requires a JVM instance with the javax.management.builder.initial property set to weblogic.management.jmx.mbeanserver.WLSMBeanServerBuilder, and a WebLogic server instance
* MBeanServer requires JDK 8 to function correctly, specifically the AdoptOpenJDK 8 distribution
* MBeanServer requires Java 1.7 or lower
* MBeanServer requires JMX (Java Management Extensions) configured and enabled, specifically with Datadog Agent for JMX fetching

**Directive**

* When using MBeanServer, get a reference to it before running a query with the ObjectName
* When using MBeanServer, ensure that the JVM property "javax.management.builder.initial" is set to "weblogic.management.jmx.mbeanserver.WLSMBeanServerBuilder" to get access to WebLogic's MBeans
* When using MBeanServer, ensure that the MBean object is properly registered and initialized before accessing its methods
* When implementing an MBean interface, ensure that the methods are thread-safe and can handle concurrent access
