Here is the API document for VariableSynchronization, organized into seven sections: functionality, concept, pattern, performance, alternative, environment, and directive.

**Functionality**

* Not explicitly mentioned in the post, but can be inferred that VariableSynchronization is related to distributed training and variable synchronization across multiple devices.

**Concept**

* A TensorFlow Variable has 4 operations/nodes: the Variable node, Identity node, Assign node, and Const node (which is the initial_value).
* The initial_value node is a constant TensorFlow node that is automatically created and is the input to the assigned node of TensorFlow Variable.
* The actual values of a Variable are stored in the initial_value node, not in the Variable node itself.
* A variable created under a MirroredStrategy is a MirroredVariable, which implies that VariableSynchronization is related to distributed training and variable synchronization across multiple devices.
* The concept of devices (GPUs or CPUs) and their visibility affects the allocation of memory and placement of operations, which is relevant to VariableSynchronization.
* TensorFlow treats all CPUs on a machine as a single device, and uses threads internally for parallelism, which might influence how VariableSynchronization works.

**Pattern**

* VariableSynchronization is commonly used in distributed training with tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy, where a variable created under a MirroredStrategy is a MirroredVariable, which is synchronized across multiple devices (GPUs or CPUs) for parallelism.
* VariableSynchronization is not necessary in TensorFlow 2.x as it is handled automatically with the use of Resource variables, which are created by default when using tf.Variable with eager execution enabled.

**Performance**

* No information available in the post.

**Alternative**

* No information available in the post.

**Environment**

* VariableSynchronization requires TensorFlow 2.x installed, with eager execution enabled by default, and supports Resource variables by default.
* VariableSynchronization requires TensorFlow installed, supports both CPU and GPU execution, and is compatible with tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy which uses all available GPUs if no devices are specified, otherwise it uses the available CPUs.

**Directive**

* When using `tf.Variable`, ensure you understand that it will always create a new variable, even if the same name is passed, and TensorFlow will assign a new name with a suffix.
* When using `tf.get_variable`, ensure you understand that it gets an existing variable with specified parameters from the graph, and if it doesn't exist, it creates a new one.
* When using `tf.get_variable` in
