# UUID API Document

## Functionality
UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is primarily used to generate unique identifiers for resources, leveraging a 128-bit structure that ensures universality and uniqueness. The `UUID.randomUUID()` method creates a new random UUID, which is not predictable and thus suitable for applications requiring unique and secure identification.

## Concept
UUIDs are designed to be universally unique, mitigating the need for a central registration authority or coordination between generating parties. This feature allows them to be generated independently across various systems without the risk of duplication, owing to the negligible chance of generating identical UUIDs.

## Pattern
- UUIDs are utilized as unique identifiers in various contexts, from database entities to user identification in web applications.
- It is recommended to pass UUIDs as parameters to constructors to maintain identifier consistency and control, possibly sourcing them from Factory objects or databases.

## Performance
UUIDs offer robust performance in applications needing unique identifiers without concerns about duplication or predictability. Their generation does not require system coordination, enhancing performance where distributed systems are involved.

## Alternative
UUIDs provide an excellent alternative to sequential identifiers, particularly in scenarios where security is a concern. Their random generation nature makes them less predictable, thus offering enhanced security over simpler, sequential alternatives.

## Environment
In Java environments, the `java.util.UUID` class is employed to generate and manage UUIDs efficiently. These identifiers are often stored in memory for use across sessions in web applications, serving as secure and reliable identifiers for user-related operations.

## Directive
To ensure consistency and control over UUIDs in class instances, avoid generating new UUIDs within constructors. Instead, inject UUID values via constructor parameters, enhancing both reliability and maintainability of resource identifiers.
