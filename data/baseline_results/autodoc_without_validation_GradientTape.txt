# TensorFlow GradientTape API Documentation

## Functionality
- **Automatic Differentiation**: `tf.GradientTape` is designed for automatic differentiation, computing gradients or jacobians with respect to input `tf.Variables`.
- **Reverse Mode Differentiation**: Gradients of recorded computations are calculated using reverse mode differentiation.
- **Multi-step Gradient Computation**: Enables computing gradients, processing them, and subsequently applying them in a multi-step process.
- **Tensor Observation**: The `watch()` method allows tracking specific tensors for gradient computation.

## Concept
- **Tape Recording**: Operations executed inside the context of `tf.GradientTape` are recorded onto a "tape," which is then used to compute gradients.
- **Graph Mode Execution**: While `tf.GradientTape` does not require a `tf.function` wrapper, it automatically operates in Graph mode.
- **Persistence**: To compute multiple gradients over the same computation, a persistent gradient tape should be created.

## Pattern
- **Higher-order Derivatives**: Create nested `GradientTape` objects to compute higher-order derivatives.
- **Gradient Processing**: After recording operations, use `tape.gradient()` outside the `with tf.GradientTape()` block to compute gradients and apply them to variables as necessary.
- **Training Multiple Models**: Aggregate trainable variables from various models and use a single `tf.GradientTape` to compute and apply gradients.

## Performance
- **Efficiency with Lists**: Calculations via `tape.gradient()` handle lists of variables, providing gradients for each variable independently, maintaining their shapes without needing concatenation.
- **Resource Management**: By default, resources are released post-gradient computation; for multiple computations, use persistent tapes.

## Alternative
- **Persistent Gradient Tapes**: Useful when computing gradients multiple times on the same computation.
- **Manual Tensor Tracking**: Utilize `tape.watch()` for manually tracking tensors that aren't automatically captured.

## Environment
- **Eager Execution**: `tf.GradientTape` operates efficiently in TensorFlow's eager execution mode (default in TensorFlow 2.x).
- **Compatibility**: Suitable for environments where TensorFlow is installed, particularly TensorFlow 2.x.

## Directive
- **Variable Setup**: Convert inputs into tensors using `tf.Variable` for "trainable" tensors as gradients are computed for such.
- **Explicit Gradient Paths**: Use `tape.watch()` to track tensors explicitly not automatically managed within the GradientTape context.
