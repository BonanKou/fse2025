Here is the API document summarizing the knowledge snippets:

**MessageDigest API Document**

**Functionality**
The MessageDigest class provides functionality for generating a message digest (a digital fingerprint) of a given input.

**Concept**
A message digest is a digital fingerprint of a given input, used for data integrity and authenticity verification.

**Pattern**
The MessageDigest class follows a streaming pattern, allowing for processing of large files in chunks.

**Performance**
* Using `digest(byteArr)` can be memory-inefficient for large files, as it requires loading the entire file into memory.
* Using `update(byteArr)` to process the file in chunks can significantly reduce memory usage.

**Alternative**
No alternative methods are specified.

**Environment**
* The MessageDigest class requires the Java Security API.
* Supports Java execution environment.

**Directive**
* When working with large files, use `update(byteArr)` to process the file in chunks to reduce memory usage.
