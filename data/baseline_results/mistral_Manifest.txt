 API Documentation for Android Manifest:

**Name:** Android Manifest

**Package:** android. manifest

**Description:** The Android Manifest is an XML file that contains application metadata, declarations of components, intents, permissions, and other essential configuration settings for an Android application.

**Key Concepts:**
- Package attribute
- Application tag
- Activity tag
- Intent filter
- Permissions
- Services
- Receivers
- Supports-screens tag
- Queries tag

**Functionality:**
1. Declare application metadata, such as name, version, and icon.
2. Define application components, including activities, services, receivers, and providers.
3. Configure application requirements, such as permissions, hardware acceleration, and external storage access.
4. Set up intent filters to create interaction between components.
5. Request API level dependencies or query other applications through the `<queries>` tag (API 30 and above).
6. Utilize build variables and configure build variants to create different application versions and configurations.
7. Inject build variables into the manifest to dynamically insert values during build time.

**Pattern:**
- Utilize the `<manifest>` tag as the root element for the Manifest XML file.
- Place the application and component elements within the `<manifest>` tag.

**Performance:**
- Optimize build times by configuring build variants and using build variables.
- Minimize potential performance impacts during runtime by baking the manifest information at compile/build time.

**Alternative:**
- No direct alternatives to the Android Manifest, but understanding Android Studio's build process and manifest management is essential.

**Environment:**
- The Manifest file should be located in the `res/manifest/` directory of an Android Studio project.
- Manifests should be modified outside the application before building the respective apps.

**Directives:**
- Ensure proper handling of the Duplication tag and File Provider integration.
- Inject build variables into the manifest and configure build variants.
- For Android 10, set `android:requestLegacyExternalStorage="true"` in the manifest to allow legacy external storage access.
- For Android 11 (Api level 30), include the `<queries>` tag within the `<manifest>` tag for specific functionalities, such as querying the permissions of other packages in the system.
- To enable hardware acceleration, set `android:hardwareAccelerated="true"` in the application or activity level of the manifest.
- To request permission for cleartext network traffic, set `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` in the application tag, but note that this feature is deprecated since API 21.
- Consider using the MediaStore and DocumentsProvider for persistent storage in Android 10+.
