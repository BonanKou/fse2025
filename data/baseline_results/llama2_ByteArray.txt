 API Document: ByteArray in Kotlin

Functionality:

* Can be used to create an array of bytes with all elements initialized to zero.
* Can be represented as a byte[] array when targeting the JVM.
* Size of the array can be accessed using the size property, which returns an int value.
* Can be used to get the least significant bit of any byte with the .takeLowestOneBit() method.
* Can be used to iterate through the bytes in a buffer to find the least significant bit of the buffer.
* Can be used to store and manipulate data in a buffer, specifically for reading and writing short values.
* Can be used in conjunction with ByteBuffer class methods to perform various operations on byte data.
* Can be used to convert objects to bytes arrays and vice versa using the ObjectSerializer class.

Concept:

* ByteArray is a class in Kotlin that represents a byte array.
* It compiles down to a simple primitive array, similar to byte[] in Java.
* It has the JVM descriptor [B.
* It can be printed as a string, starting with [B.
* It can be used with [B as a suggestion for working with byte arrays.

Pattern:

* Using ByteArray to create a new array of bytes with a specified size.
* Accessing the size of a ByteArray using the size property.
* Using the .takeLowestOneBit() method to get the least significant bit of any byte.
* Iterating through the bytes in a buffer to find the least significant bit of the buffer.
* Wrapping a ByteArray into a ByteBuffer to read and write short values.
* Using the ObjectSerializer class to convert objects to bytes arrays and vice versa.
