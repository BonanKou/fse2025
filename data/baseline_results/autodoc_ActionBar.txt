# API Document for ActionBar

### Functionality
- Provides a dedicated space for app identity and indicates user location within the app.
- Ensures predictable access to important actions, such as search.
- Supports navigation and view switching using tabs or drop-down lists.
- Reduces UI clutter through the action overflow for infrequently used actions.
- Consistently sets the title of the ActionBar at the top of the activity screen: `actionBar.setTitle("ACTIONBAR TITLE");`.

### Concept
- The ActionBar is a salient feature present at the top of activity screens in mobile applications.
- It offers a consistent presence across all activities, contributing to user familiarity.
  
### Pattern
- Set titles in the ActionBar using `getSupportActionBar()`, and ensure synchronization between ActionBar and any custom Toolbars.
- Use `actionBar.setTitle("ACTIONBAR TITLE");` to set or update the ActionBar title.

### Performance
- ActionBar ensures a consistent and familiar user interface, improving user experience by providing an accessible and organized UI element.

### Alternative
- **Toolbar**: Functions as a View and can be included in layouts like any other View. Offers more flexibility in positioning, animations, and control with the option to utilize multiple Toolbars within a single activity.
- **AppBarConfiguration with NavigationUI**: For managing navigation UI, it integrates with `DrawerLayout` and `NavigationView`, eliminating the need for `ActionBarDrawerToggle`.

### Environment
- Suitable for Android applications, especially those leveraging the navigation component to switch between views and ensure consistent UI element presence.

### Directive
- Avoid setting titles concurrently for the ActionBar and a custom Toolbar to prevent conflicts.
- Utilize ActionBar for consistent app-wide UI presence, and Toolbar for more localized dynamic use cases.
