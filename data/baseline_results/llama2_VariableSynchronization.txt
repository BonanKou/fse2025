 API Document: VariableSynchronization

Functionality:

* Allows saving and restoring of TensorFlow variables as raw numpy arrays.
* Enables assignment of trained values to parameters in TensorFlow 1 using the name-value dictionary.
* Creates a Resource variable as the default with eager execution enabled by default in TensorFlow 2.x.
* Allows disabling of Resource variable using the option use_resource=False in tf.get_variable().
* tf.get_variable() gets an existing variable with specified parameters from the graph, and if it doesn't exist, it creates a new one.
* tf.Variable() will always create a new variable, even if the same name is passed.

Concept:

* VariableSynchronization is a technique used in TensorFlow to synchronize variables across different parts of the system.

Pattern:

* Using VariableSynchronization to save and restore TensorFlow variables as raw numpy arrays.
* Using VariableSynchronization to assign trained values to parameters in TensorFlow 1 using the name-value dictionary.

Performance:

* The post mentions that using VariableSynchronization might not be the easiest way to run the conversion, and it could be cumbersome and not very performant.
* It's recommended to explore other options and optimize the code for better performance.

Alternative:

* Other ways to perform the conversion, such as using tf.get_variable() or tf.Variable(), are available and may be more efficient and optimal.

Environment:

* TensorFlow 1 and TensorFlow 2.x are the environments in which VariableSynchronization can be used.

Directive:

* It's recommended to use the option use_resource=False in tf.get_variable() to disable the Resource variable in TensorFlow 2.x.
* It's recommended to explore other options and optimize the code for better performance.
