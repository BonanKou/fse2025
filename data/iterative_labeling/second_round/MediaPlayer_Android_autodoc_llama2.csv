"Knowledge type: functionality
- MediaPlayer is used to play audio and video in Android applications.
- MediaPlayer handles audio input independent of file extension, provided it is encoded as audio.
- MediaPlayer can play media from local sources and supports streaming.

"The `isPlaying()` method checks if media is currently playing.
- `stop()` method halts playback, and `prepare()` must be called before playback can resume.
- MediaPlayer allows playback speed adjustment and supports seeking.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
- It supports looping functionality for continuous playback.,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1
"- Volume control is available during playback.
- MediaPlayer works with the Equalizer for audio enhancements.

"- After calling `stop()` on `MediaPlayer`, use `prepare()` before `start()` to resume playback, due to required state transitions.
- Proper playback control with `MediaPlayer` necessitates managing media states like playing, paused, and stopped, using methods like `stop()`, `prepare()`, and `start()` appropriately.
