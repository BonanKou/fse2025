"Knowledge type: functionality
Here is a concise and accurate list summarizing the knowledge snippets:

- ByteArray is used to store binary data in Kotlin.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1
"- A ByteArray can be converted to a String using `String(byteArray)`.
-",1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0
"An Int can be written to a ByteArray by breaking it down into four bytes, using bit shifting and conversion methods like `toByte()`.
- Direct indexing allows modification of specific bytes in a ByteArray.
